# Stock Market Signal Prediction

## Overview
This project explores whether machine learning can support better investment decisions by predicting short-term stock price movements. By analyzing over 14 years of Tesla (TSLA) daily stock data, we developed a binary classifier to identify "Up Opportunities" â€” days when stock returns are likely to exceed a predefined threshold. The ultimate goal is to support retail investors in improving market timing strategies and managing downside risk.

Prepared by: Vy Nguyen, Dennis Wu, Kenjee Koh, Hsiang-Han Huang, Becky Wang

Key results include:
- Gradient Boosting model achieved 59.03% accuracy on unseen data (random split)
- Final model showed 36% precision for Class 1 (up opportunities), supporting better downside risk control
- Feature importance analysis revealed MA Ratio, Volatility, and RSI as top predictors
- A scenario simulation projected a 393% annual return under specific trading assumptions

> **Strategic Insight:** In volatile markets, avoiding poor trades can be more valuable than aggressively chasing gains. Our model prioritizes conservative entry signals, helping investors identify when **not** to trade as much as when to trade.

## Tools & Methodology Overview
**Languages and Libraries:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Data Processing:
- Downloaded historical TSLA data using `yfinance`
- Engineered 6 technical indicators: MA Ratio, RSI, Volatility, Volume Change, Price Trend, and Day of Week
- Created a binary target variable (`Signal`) to classify "Up Opportunity" days

### Exploratory Analysis:
- Analyzed class distribution (balanced: 44.8% Up vs 55.2% No Opportunity)
- Performed summary statistics and outlier checks
- Evaluated correlation and feature distributions

### Modeling Techniques:
- Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
- Applied RandomizedSearchCV and TimeSeriesSplit (5 folds) for hyperparameter tuning
- Tested two data-splitting strategies: random and chronological

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (overall and class-specific)
- Feature importance analysis
- Investment scenario simulation based on prediction results

## Results & Key Insights

### Overall Model Performance

| Test Accuracy (%)           | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting |
|----------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Random split               | 56.33         | 55.96          | **59.03**         |
| Random split + tuning      | **57.54**     | 57.26          | 58.84             |
| Chronological split        | 49.53         | 54.38          | 55.95             |
| Chronological + tuning     | 57.17         | 56.61          | 57.08             |

### Class 1 Accuracy (Up Opportunity)

| Class 1 Accuracy (%)       | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting |
|----------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Random split               | 54            | 42             | **36**            |
| Random split + tuning      | 25            | **43**         | 36                |
| Chronological split        | **56**        | 44             | 43                |
| Chronological + tuning     | 16            | **52**         | 7                 |

- **Gradient Boosting** with random split gave the **highest overall test accuracy (59.03%)**
- However, **Random Forest** with chronological split + tuning achieved better **Class 1 detection** (52%)
- **Feature importance** revealed MA_Ratio, Volatility, and RSI as dominant predictors
- **Day-of-week** variable contributed little value
- Scenario simulation (targeting Class 1 days) suggested **strong upside potential with low risk exposure**
- Final model serves as a conservative signal generator: prefer **avoiding poor trades** over chasing risky wins

## What I Learned
- Tree-based models can identify interpretable patterns in technical indicators but may not fully capture market dynamics
- The cost of false positives (bad trades) in finance is higher than missing opportunities â€” model precision matters more than recall
- Gradual improvements in model performance come from careful feature engineering and strategic evaluation design
- Classification of stock returns has limits â€” price direction alone doesnâ€™t guarantee profit potential

---

## What I Plan to Improve
- Extend model to other stocks and broader asset classes
- Introduce economic indicators and sentiment-based signals (e.g., VIX, macro data, social sentiment)
- Test sequential models (e.g., LSTM, Temporal CNNs) that can capture price momentum and reversal patterns
- Simulate alternative trading strategies (e.g., risk-adjusted return, Sharpe ratio optimization)
